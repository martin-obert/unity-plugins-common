# Unity Plugins - Common

This package contains mainly scripts with implementation of features that I've frequently used in variety of my projects and had to implement them over and over again.

# FEATURES
## Scene Orchestration

Best to use when working with multi scene workflow, so mainly larger projects

- fasten up the load of your application, especially when using streaming assets (like Addressables)
- ability to group scenes into logic
