# Basic Sample

This sample demonstrates how you can utilize ```Scene Group Manager``` to

- create lightweighted entry point scene for your object to handle pre-game logic
- organize your scenes into groups of scriptable objects
- give your scenes more context for ex.: "Display this on overlay while loading"

**IMPORTANT**

- due Unity folder system, when importing this sample just check at each folder with scene (ex: Scenes/Level 1 etc.) and assign the scene in that folder to the associated scriptable object
